[Smart Home](https://my-smart-home-project.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary

Smart Home app allows the user to monitor their smart devices' state. Properties displayed within a device card depend on the type of the appliance chosen. The set of devices currently listed within the app is based on a simple mock API. There is a "toggle connection" button in every device card, making it possible to test whether the API is functioning properly. Built with React, Bootstrap and TypeScript.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. In order to improve the way device information is updated, I am planning to replace the periodic API requests by implementing the WebSocket protocol.
